Description of all tables in the Database:


1. MAIN_TABLE:

     Structure : MAIN_TABLE(STATE_ID INT(2),STATE_NAME VARCHAR(30),DIST_ID INT(2),DIST_NAME VARCHAR(35));

     - Contains all states and union territories with their STATE_IDs and all their districts with their DIST_IDs.
     - All the states and districts are sorted alphabetically (a-z) (and were assigned IDs accordingly).
     - DIST_ID = 0 indicates total of data of all districts of that state (i.e. data for the whole state / state wise data) and DIST_NAME = ALL.
       (This was added for tables (containing district wise data) in which the district wise data for some states was not available.)
	
	
** For all tables, value 0 for any column except STATE_ID and DIST_ID and URT_ID(for HH) indicates that the data was not available.

	
2. POP_district wise:
 
     Structure: POP_district wise(STATE_ID INT(2), DIST_ID INT(2), POP_2001 DECIMAL(10,0), POP_2011 DECIMAL(10,0));
   
     - Contains district wise population for all states (has no row with DIST_ID = 0).
   
   
  
3. GDP_district wise:
   
     Structure: GDP_district wise(STATE_ID INT(2), DIST_ID INT(2), GDP_2008_09 DECIMAL(12,5), GDP_2009_10 DECIMAL(12,5), GDP_2010_11 DECIMAL(12,5));

     - Contains Gross Domestic Product at Constant 2004-05 Prices (in Rs. Crore).
     - Contains district wise data for some states and state wise data for remaining states.
      (i.e. has rows with DIST_ID = 0 for states not having district wise data, indicating state wise data).

   
   
4. PCI_state wise:

     Structure: PCI_state wise(STATE_ID INT(2),PCI_2009_10 DECIMAL(10,0),PCI_2010_11 DECIMAL(10,0));
	
	 - Contains Per Capita Income at Constant Price (in Rs).
	 - Contains only state wise data.
	
	
5. LITERACY_state wise:
 
     Structure: LITERACY_state wise(STATE_ID INT(2), LIT_2001 DECIMAL(6,3), LIT_2011 DECIMAL(6,3));

	 - Contains state wise Literacy Rates (in per cent).

   

6. GROSS_ENROLL_RATIO:

     Structure: GROSS_ENROLL_RATIO(STATE_ID INT(2),ALL_MALE DECIMAL(6,3),ALL_FEMALE DECIMAL(6,3),ALL_TOTAL DECIMAL(6,3), SC_MALE DECIMAL(6,3),
	                              SC_FEMALE DECIMAL(6,3),SC_TOTAL DECIMAL(6,3),ST_MALE DECIMAL(6,3),ST_FEMALE DECIMAL(6,3),ST_TOTAL DECIMAL(6,3));
    
     - Contains Gross Enrollment Ratio in age group 18-23 (higher education) for 2010-11.
     - Contains only state wise data.
	
	
7. HH:

    Structure: HH(STATE_ID INT(2), URT_ID INT(1), HHSIZE_1 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_2 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_3 DECIMAL(10,0),
	               HHSIZE_4 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_5 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_6 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_7_10 DECIMAL(10,0),
		           HHSIZE_11_14 DECIMAL(10,0), HHSIZE_15_MORE DECIMAL(10,0), MEAN_HHSIZE DECIMAL(2,1));

    - Primary key : (STATE_ID,URT_ID).		  
				  
    Column description:
	     - 1. STATE_ID.
	     - 2. URT_ID has values : {0, 1, 2} where 0=Urban, 1=Rural, 2=Total(i.e. rural + urban).
